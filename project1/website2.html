				<h1>In this day and age, ‘inclusive’ is of paramount importance within and beyond the design world. Although there have been immense advancements in talking about and approaching design through the lens of inclusivity, which individuals are overlooked or unnoticed? </h1>
	     	 	
	     	 	<p class="solid"> Just as the sighted visually navigate the world  through words, the visually impaired are lost without Braille. In a world populated by around 217 million visually impaired, should we be rethinking the way we communicate? That seems to be exactly what Braille Neue has presented us.</p>

				<h1>Instead of separating the Latin and Braille alphabet, Japanese designer Kosuke Takahashi has overlaid letterform strokes onto a grid of corresponding Braille dots. Braille Neue, the universal typeface designed in 2018, communicates to both the sighted and the visually impaired at a glance – or at a touch. This makes it easier to contain information in the same space, instead of one being neglected in favor of space.</h1>
				<h1>In Japan, Braille Neue has been implemented at public offices such as the Shibuya City Office and company buildings of Panasonic and Dentsu. It’s been featured in more than a hundred media outlets and efforts are in action to implement Braille Neue for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics. On top of that, Braille Neue is working towards applying the type to general software and making it accessible to print.</h1>
				<h1>Braille Neue has even launched an open community for developing a multilingual version. It’s still a work-in-progress but already serves the mission of creating a world where Braille Neue is the new standard.</h1>
				<h1>Although it is not too visually clear, Braille Neue is based on the Helvetica Neue font. It comes in two styles –  standard and outline. The Braille Neue standard combines tactile Braille dots with Latin alphabets, and the Braille Neue outline uses both Latin alphabets and Japanese characters. Takahashi came up with the idea when he realized the fact that he can’t read Braille. So, he began to think of a clever way to help people learn Braille the easiest way possible. </h1> 
				<h1>In the process of designing, Kosuke Takahashi did research to see whether braille could be put into design beyond its set scale. Large signages, such as ‘Exit’ signs and toilet signs, could be read by visually impaired people as long as it was still within the boundaries of 6 dots.</h1> 
				<h1>His hope is that the typeface will allow braille to be included in signage for public spaces. 
				“is still experimenting with cost-effective printing and is refining the font prior to final release” has the potential to spread not just awareness but literacy of Braille, given that it essentially shows sighted non-Braille readers a key every time they read it. With Braille Neue, it is also possible to overwrite existing signage in public space by adjusting the kerning (space between letters). It is easy to implement into the existing infrastructure and is a stepping stone for a sustainable and inclusive future.</h1>
				<h1>“Braille tends to be small and invisible, but with Braille Neue, it has the possibility to expand spatially into large signage in new ways. We aim for an inclusive society where using braille becomes commonplace.”</h1>
