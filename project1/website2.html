	     	 	In a world populated by around 217 million visually impaired individuals, is design catering to both the visually impaired and sighted alike? Should we be rethinking the way we communicate? <mark>Braille Neue</mark>, designed in <mark>2018</mark> by Kosuke Takahashi, pays tribute to Helvetia Neue, in hopes of offering an updated version of Braille so that it can be incorporated more fluently into public spaces. </p>
				<p class="k1">In Braille Neue, <mark>Kosuke Takahashi</mark> has overlaid letterform strokes onto a grid of corresponding Braille dots. The typeface, aims to communicate to both the sighted and the visually impaired at a glance – or at a <mark>touch</mark>. This makes it easier to contain information in the same space, instead of one being neglected in favor of space.</p>

				<p class="k1">In Japan, Braille Neue has been implemented at public offices such as the <mark>Shibuya City Office</mark> and company buildings of Panasonic and Dentsu. It has been featured in more than a hundred media outlets and efforts are in action to implement Braille Neue for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics. On top of that, Braille Neue is working towards applying the type to general software and making it <mark>accessible</mark> to print.</p>

				<p class="k1"> Braille Neue comes in two styles –  <mark>standard</mark> and <mark>outline</mark>. The Braille Neue standard combines tactile Braille dots with Latin alphabets, and the Braille Neue outline uses both Latin alphabets and Japanese characters. Takahashi came up with the idea when he realized the fact that he can’t read Braille. So, he began to think of a way to help people learn Braille the easiest way possible. </p> 
				
				<p class="k1">Kosuke Takahashi conducted research to see whether braille could be put into design <mark>beyond its set scale</mark>. Large signages, such as ‘Exit’ signs and toilet signs, could be read by visually impaired people as long as it was still within the boundaries of 6 dots.</p>

				<p class="k1">His hope is that the typeface will allow braille to be included in signages for public spaces. Takahashi is still experimenting with cost-effective printing and is refining the font prior to final release. Braille Neue has the potential to spread not just awareness but literacy of Braille, given that it essentially shows sighted non-Braille readers a key every time they read it. With Braille Neue, it is also possible to overwrite existing signage in public space by adjusting the kerning (space between letters). It is easy to implement into the existing infrastructure and is a stepping stone for a <mark>sustainable and inclusive future</mark>.</p>
