    <p>A weave consists of warp yarns and weft yarns. The warp lies parallel with the selvage of the fabric, and supports the network of weft yarns. The weft consists of  horizontal threads that weave across the warp yarns. </p>
    <h1>PLAIN WEAVE</h1>
    <section id="intro" class="weave">
      <div id="bigletter2">0</div>
    </section>

    <p>A plain weave is the most common and simplest weave structure. It is considered very durable and is often used for apparel and interior fabrics. In a plain weave, the warp and weft yarns cross at right angles and go over and under each other. </p>

    <h1>TWILL WEAVE</h1>   
    <section id="intro" class="weave">
      <div id="bigletter4">1</div>
    </section>
    <p>A twill weave can be identified by the diagonals across the weave. It is made by passing the weft thread over one or more warp threads then under two or more warp threads and so on, with a "step," or offset, between rows to create the characteristic diagonal pattern.Because of this structure, twill generally drapes well.</p>

    <h1>BASKET WEAVE</h1>
    <section id="intro" class="weave">
      <div id="bigletter4">2</div>
    </section>
    <p>A Basket weave can be identified by the diagonals across the weave. It is a secondary form of plain weave, with two or more weft and warp yarns alternating to resemble a checkerboard effect. It is identified by its crisscross pattern that forms a checkered design with two or more threads in one group. It is versatile and highly breathable. The knits of a basketweave fabric are loose, hence its breathability. It is noticeably different from plain weave as it commands a burst of colors that can lighten up your mood without being too much.</p>

    <h1>SATIN WEAVE</h1>            
    <section id="intro" class="weave">
      <div id="bigletter4">3</div>
    </section>
    <p>A satin weave is a type of fabric weave that produces a characteristically glossy, smooth or lustrous material, typically with a glossy top surface and a dull back. It is one of three fundamental types of textile weaves alongside plain weave and twill weave. The satin weave is characterised by four or more fill or weft yarns floating over a warp yarn, and four warp yarns floating over a single weft yarn. Floats are missed interfacings, for example where the warp yarn lies on top of the weft in a warp-faced satin. These floats explain the high lustre and even sheen, as unlike in other weaves, light is not scattered as much when hitting the fibres, resulting in a stronger reflection. Satin is usually a warp-faced weaving technique in which warp yarns are "floated" over weft yarns, although there are also weft-faced satins.</p>

    <h1>HERRINGBONE WEAVE</h1>
    <section id="intro" class="weave">
      <div id="bigletter4">4</div>
    </section>
    <p>Herringbone weave can be identified by the V shape. The pattern is arranged in columns of alternating diagonal lines. Herringbone pattern was first used in the Roman Empire for constructing roads, where bricks weer laid in a zig-zag pattern. This allowed for compression and easy flow of fabric. With time, herringbone weave structure became popular for menswear. </p>
