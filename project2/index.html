    <p>Herringbone weave can be identified by the V shape. The pattern is arranged in columns of alternating diagonal lines. Herringbone pattern was first used in the Roman Empire for constructing roads, where bricks weer laid in a zig-zag pattern. This allowed for compression and easy flow of fabric. With time, herringbone weave structure became popular for menswear. </p>
